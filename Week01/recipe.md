2. In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugar until well-combined.
3. Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.
4. Add the flour, baking soda, and salt.
5. Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.
6. Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place 2 inches apart on baking sheet.
